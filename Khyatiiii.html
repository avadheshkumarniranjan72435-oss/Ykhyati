      Are you looking up<br>
      Are you looking up like I do<br>
      I could be right beside you..<br><br>

      Just so you know this isn't chatgpt.... It's actually a song..😅😅😅<br>
      So myyyy betuu jii... Kaisi ho aap?? Achhi hogi mere saath jo ho... Or abhi to koii jhagda bhii nhi hai to guess Happy happy hi hogi... Well this is to make you more happy happy.... Hayeee kitni khubsurat ladki haii... Actually I am writing this with your face in my head... So could get something write.. As abhi tk to apko pta lg hi gya hoga kii I don't know how to write these and all......<br><br>

      But still gotta give it my all.. To write and show you what I can... To aapk khoos...burat toh hai... haa khoos..burat hote honge log khoobsurat lekin tum.. You are more than that... You know everything in this world is just so perfect so that life on this planet is possible.. if the calculations would be slightly different like if the gravity would be a little more or less we wouldn't be able to survive same for the temperature of our plane and many more... And I am glad that it is.. Cause I got to meet you...<br><br>

      
      If it wasn't perfect.. life wouldn't be possible and if there were no life we wouldn't exist and if we wouldn't exist how would we meet...<br>
      Ye toh ho gyii paragraph bada karne wali baatein... You know what I Love You... I Love You so so much... You just matter so much to me.. You.. You now have control over my habits.... If you say something and I don't follow eventually I will feel a little bad for not doing it... But aapke kuchh aadesh are beyond my capabilities.... So I am unable to complete them.. Ans yes I do apologize for it....<br><br>
      But you know what I am so thankful that you came into my life even I wasn't searching for you but you came in at right time... Haath toh isme Khushi ka bhi hai.. If she wasn't my bestfriend then we wouldn't have met.. I am so glad we did...<br>
      Now I have a very beautiful and little bit samajhdar future wife... And Thank you for coming into my life and making it so so so much better and beautiful than before.... Thank you.. Thank you so much... I trust you so much just don't let it break... <br>
      I Love You....<br>
      Pahli bar itna sab kisi k liye hai... Hayee ram ye kaam hard toh hai...
      Lekin ab jb likhne betha hu toh my words aren't ending I am not feeling loss on words now... For some reason I think can just continue writing more ad more and more... So Writing jb tk mn kar rha hai... It's 4 in the morning now... The motive to make this website wasn't really an apology or anything but I guess it would help me making up for my mistakes and making you understand that there's no breakup between us... Not in the slightest chance... Aaah hath thak gye typing se... But I still think sometimes.... actually not sometimes but most of the times that.. how in the hell I got you...<br>
      Kaise pat gyii itnii sundar si ladkii woh bhi mere se... Kaisee.... Ab jaise bhi pati ho.. Lekin ab toh pat gyi or fas gyii.. For life time you are stuck with me now.... And I don't know how you would deal with me and my jeoulsy.... Orr ab toh tumhari I'D login krli toh I am more insecure now... like someone like.. Samnvay or something... But I am more insecure now...🥲🥲<br>
      Topic se bhatak gye hum.. Back on track...Abhi k liye yaha samaapt karte hai.... <br><br>
      Hope You Liked The Surprise<br>
      In the end...<br>
      I LOVE YOU ❤️
